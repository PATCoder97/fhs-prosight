# Task: Add Pydantic Schemas for Achievement Data

## Description

Add two simple Pydantic models to the existing `backend/app/schemas/hrs_data.py` file to support achievement/evaluation data responses. These schemas follow the exact same patterns as the existing salary schemas in the file.

This is a minimal extension: only 2 new models with a total of ~20 lines of code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `Achievement` model created with 2 fields (year, score)
- [ ] `AchievementResponse` model created with 3 fields (employee_id, employee_name, achievements)
- [ ] Field descriptions include both Vietnamese and English translations
- [ ] OpenAPI example values provided in Config class
- [ ] Models use proper Pydantic types (str, List[Achievement])
- [ ] File syntax validates with Python parser
- [ ] Follows existing code style in hrs_data.py

## Technical Details

**File to modify**: `backend/app/schemas/hrs_data.py`

**New Models**:

```python
class Achievement(BaseModel):
    """Single achievement/evaluation record."""
    year: str = Field(..., description="Evaluation year (Năm đánh giá)")
    score: str = Field(..., description="Achievement score (Điểm đánh giá): 甲, 優, etc.")

    class Config:
        json_schema_extra = {
            "example": {
                "year": "2024",
                "score": "甲"
            }
        }


class AchievementResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for achievement queries."""
    employee_id: str = Field(..., description="Employee ID (Mã nhân viên)")
    employee_name: str = Field(..., description="Employee name (Tên nhân viên)")
    achievements: List[Achievement] = Field(..., description="List of achievements across years")

    class Config:
        json_schema_extra = {
            "example": {
                "employee_id": "VNW0006204",
                "employee_name": "PHAN ANH TUẤN",
                "achievements": [
                    {"year": "2024", "score": "甲"},
                    {"year": "2023", "score": "甲"},
                    {"year": "2022", "score": "優"}
                ]
            }
        }
```

**Location**: Add at the end of the file, after existing salary schemas

**Pattern to follow**: Mirror the structure of `SalaryResponse` and related models already in the file

## Dependencies

- [ ] File `backend/app/schemas/hrs_data.py` exists (from salary API)
- [ ] Pydantic BaseModel available (already imported)
- [ ] Field and List types available (already imported)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 1 hour
- Parallel: false (blocks all other tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and added to hrs_data.py
- [ ] File syntax validates (no Python errors)
- [ ] Models match the example structure exactly
- [ ] UTF-8 encoding handles Japanese characters (甲, 優)
- [ ] Committed with message: "Issue #XX: Add Pydantic schemas for achievement data"
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing salary schemas
